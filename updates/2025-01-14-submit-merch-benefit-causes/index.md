# 2025-01-14: Submit Merch Designs To Benefit Specific Causes

We are launching a new merch store both online and in person which will host designs submitted by contributors and readers who want to benefit particular causes.

If you have a cause you want to raise money for, you can submit a design and specify the cause to which the proceeds will be donated.

These causes will be well researched, transparently to mitigate the risk of scams and fraud that have plagued many social media fundraising campaigns.
