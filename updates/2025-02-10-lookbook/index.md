## Introducing Lookbook

This project, many years in the making, will highlight the tools and systems and procedures being used by organizations and nonprofits to solve specific problems like volunteer coordination or how to close a street for an event.

We will feature interviews with local organizers and focus on free open source options that empower groups to solve these key problems.
