# 2024-12-23: Announcing The Social Murder Institute


**Social murder:** *unnatural death that is believed to occur due to social, political, or economic oppression, instead of direct violence.*

This new institute researches and publishes data attributing harms in society to the organizations and policies directly responsible for them.

If youâ€™d like to volunteer on this project, please reach out.
