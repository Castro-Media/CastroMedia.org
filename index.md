## Uniting Voices To Amplify Change
 *We are a flat anarcho-syndicalist organization where every member has the same power to contribute, vote on decisions, and review content before it goes out. We are working towards having monthly public meetings whose agenda and minutes will be posted on Substack.*

## Programs

- **What's Happening Around Town:** We are working on a community-driven system to see all the events going on wherever you are, and information from activists about active boycotts.
- **Social Murder Institute:** Documenting the way policies and policymakers choose to cause unnecessary harm.
  - **KleptNews.org:** Documenting the way oligarchs steal from the people and the future to enrich themselves.
- **Beneficial Merch:** Contributors will be able to create merchandise whose revenue goes directly to specific, worthy causes.
