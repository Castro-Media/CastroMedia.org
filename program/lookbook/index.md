## 👀 Lookbook 👀

*How do you close a street for an event?*  
  
*How do you track volunteers?*  
  
*How do you create a nonprofit so you don't have to pay taxes on your gofundme?*  
  
*What kind of camera/microphone does your favorite podcaster use?*  
  
The goal of the lookbook is to interview organizations and individuals who are doing the work of building community and creating culture.
