## Social Murder Institute

[Social murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_murder): unnatural death that is believed to occur due to social, political, or economic oppression, instead of direct violence.

This new institute researches and publishes data and analysis attributing harms in society to the organizations and policies directly responsible for them.
